# Web_scrapers

Implemented a Web Scraper in using Go to get transaction data from ESPN on NBA teams.
Used the golang.org/x/net/html package for scraping through Wikipedia and ESPN websites.
In order to run enter:
```bash
go build .
./NBA_Trades
```
Future additions to this project include tests, more transaction sources, and concurrency.
